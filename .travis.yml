# specifying other dists doesn't make sense because `trusty` doesn't have `oraclejdk8` (fails due to `Sorry, but JDK '[oraclejdk8]' is not known.`) which is the only supported JDK currently. Testing on Mac OSX doesn't make too much sense since it will run the same `maven` based build routine.

jdk:
- oraclejdk8
# `openjdk8` not available

before_install:
- git clone https://github.com/krichter722/maven-parent && cd maven-parent && mvn install && cd ..
